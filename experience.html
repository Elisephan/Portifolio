I saved almost $ 300,000 through proposing an alternative course of action to my employer. I did a cost benefit analysis between what was being done before I join the organisation and my new proposal. It was renting vs buying some construction machineries. I showed my supervisor my analysis, and then senior leadership approved it. By the end of the project, my proposal yielded positive results as I anticipated. I worked with a consultant to claim VAT when project was closed out  and got VAT refund of more than $150,000.
